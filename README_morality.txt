morality.html & america.csv

The morality.html is a modification of the social media code that you showed in class. It was surprisingly difficult to get your code to work using America.csv due to the variety of answers that the participants gave.

I decided to work with your code rather than search for a library online because I have very little experience in front-end work, so I felt that it would be valuable to learn from your code in detail to see how it worked.

america.csv has been modified to make it compatible with the code, so it will not work unless the supplied america.csv is used.
